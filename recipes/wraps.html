    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These lettuce wraps are bursting with Asian flavors, 
        delicious, and a great idea for entertaining or a family-style 
        meal. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the beef 
        mixture into a lettuce leaf. Wrap the lettuce around the 
        beef like a burrito and enjoy!</p>
